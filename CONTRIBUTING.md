## Development Setup

1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-fork-url>
   cd vllm-server-config
   ```

2. **Create a Development Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Test Environment**
   - Ensure you have access to compatible hardware (see README.md requirements)
   - Set up a virtual environment for testing
   - Use the provided `environment-template.sh` as a starting point

## Configuration Testing

### Required Testing

Before submitting configuration changes, please test:

1. **Startup Success**
   - Script runs without errors
   - Model loads successfully
   - API endpoint responds

2. **Memory Usage**
   - Monitor GPU memory utilization
   - Check for memory leaks during operation
   - Document maximum stable context length

3. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - Measure tokens per second
   - Test response latency
   - Document any quality changes (if applicable)

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Script has proper error handling
- [ ] Environment variables are validated
- [ ] Logs are written to appropriate locations
- [ ] API key handling is secure
- [ ] Compatible with existing directory structure

## Submitting Changes

## Code Style Guidelines

### Shell Scripts

1. **Header Format**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Script Name - Brief Description
   # Purpose and configuration details
   #
   # Configuration:
   # - Key parameters and settings
   # - Hardware requirements
   # - Performance characteristics
   ```

2. **Error Handling**
   ```bash
   set -e  # Exit on error
   
   # Validate environment variables
   if [[ -z "$REQUIRED_VAR" ]]; then
       echo "Error: REQUIRED_VAR must be set"
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

3. **Logging**
   ```bash
   # Use timestamped logs
   LOG_FILE="/var/log/vllm/script_name_$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log"
   mkdir -p "$(dirname "$LOG_FILE")"
   ```
